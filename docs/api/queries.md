# Queries

Highlight types without user interaction.

```ts twoslash
const foo = 'bar'
//    ^?
```

## Example

Add a `// ^?` comment pointing to where you want to query.

````md
```ts twoslash
const foo = 'bar'
//    ^?
```
````

::: tip

You might need to add whitespace between `//` and `^?` to point to where you want.
